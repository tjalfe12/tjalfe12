Hi!
I'm Anders, though they call me tjalfe12. 

I'm a multimedia designer, but also a web developement student at this point in time. 
I greatly enjoy coding in many forms, and can easily spend hours on end going down the coding rabbit hole. 
It seems you can always go deeper, no matter what you're looking at.

Currently I'm expanded my knowledge on React, while dipping into Ionic as well and starting to do a few exercise projects in Remix, for something a bit different. 


You can always reach me here -> abo-portfolio.onrender.com
